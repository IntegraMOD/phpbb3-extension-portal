phpbb3-extension-portal
-----------------------

Fully integrated portal for phpBB 3.1.x

**Development Status:**  

**Due to illness updates may be delayed**  
Updated for RC3 please use this repository for testing only,  

* Migration complete, only remains to seed the database tables (currently done manually)... 
* ACP: Complete and fully working...
* The portal Page complete and working (a little more to do)...
...  

Test migration added...  
Please be aware this is for testing only... there's a lot more work to be done...

To avail of blocks on index/viewtopics/viewforums or any other phpBB pages, you need to manually copy the block folder from phpbbireland/portal/styles/common/template/ to phpBB root /styles/prosilver/template folder...
This is a temporary fix till I find a solution...
